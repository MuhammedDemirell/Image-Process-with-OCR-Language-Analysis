L2 English Article Use by L1 Speakers of Article-less Languages: A Learner Corpus
Study

Abstract
This paper presents an Integrated Contrastive Model (Granger, 1996) of L2 English article
use from the L2 English written production of L1 speakers of three article-less languages
(Mandarin Chinese, Korean and Thai) - across four L2 proficiency levels. Data is sourced
from the International Corpus Network of Asian Leamers of English (ICNALE, Ishikawa,
2011, 2013), comprising 575 written essays totalling 125,588 words across two task prompts.
Accuracy of L2 zero, indefinite and definite article use is measured using Pica's (1983) Target
Language Use across Bickerton’s (1981) semantic/pragmatic article contexts (generic,
specific definite, specific indefinite and non-specific indefinite). The results show two
different orders of article accuracy depending on L1 background, as well as effects of task
type on the accuracy of certain article forms, and evidence of pseudo-longitudinal
development for particular article usages as L2 proficiency increases, although not in all
cases. Massive overproduction of indefinite/definite articles in generic contexts is
problematic for all three L2 groups regardless of L1 background and L2 proficiency.
However, Mandarin L2 English users appear to enjoy a significant advantage in L2 article
accuracy over Korean or Thai L2 English users in almost all article contexts and L2
proficiencies, providing further potential evidence that the often reported grammaticalisation
of definiteness/specificity markers in L1 Mandarin is aiding Mandarin L2 English users’
acquisition of the English article system.
